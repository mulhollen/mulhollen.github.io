        Olivia is a curious, intelligent, and outgoing second grader with a strong love of the arts. She learns best when she can relate to content. Olivia responds well to the addition of technology in static activities; to her, the added tech element makes the experience fun and engaging.<br/><br/>Michelle is a busy mother of two that likes to invest time into cultural activities with her kids on the weekend. She wants her kids to love to learn and strives to make education fun. Itâ€™s important for Michelle to create memorable experiences with her kids.

      title: "The Challenge:",
      p: `<p>
        Art, especially gallery art and museum art, can be hard to digest and alienating for children. The goal of Art Investigator is to make museum art understandable, relatable, and fun for children at an early reading age (7-11 years old). The challenge was creating a learning based app that grows emotional intelligence, relates children to the artist, and creates interaction points for parents and their children without overwhelming the exhibit itself.<br/><br/>Working with Early Childhood Education Teacher, Rebecca Sacramone, and K-12 Education Technology Professional of The Cleveland Institute of Music, Heather Young Mandujano, a lesson plan focusing on Nick Cave, his wide range of artistic mediums, and the related emotional intelligence of vulnerability was developed. Working with Adventure Science Center designer Jim Savelyev, interaction points for parents and their children were constructed.
